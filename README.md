################# Logistic Regression and SVM ################

### Concept: 
Implementation of Binary and Multi-Class Logistic Regression along with implementation of Support Vector Model using multiple kernels.

### Implementation:
* Both the logistic models are tested for their accuracy with given Training, Testing and Validating data sets. 
* Support Vector Model is evaluated by using different Kernels and Gamma values.
* A Detailed report is provided with the conclusions.
